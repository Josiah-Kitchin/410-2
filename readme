Dot Product (Hai)
I created an arrow that changes color depending on if the player is facing the direction of the exit or not. It changes to red if they are facing the opposite direction, 
meaning that the dot product was less than or equal to 0. It turns green if the player is facing the exit, meaning that the dot product is greater than 0.

Linear Interpolation (Josiah)

Particle Effect (Axel)

Sound Effect (Miro)
I created a trigger so that if you walk into the bathroom 
straight ahead, you will notice a strange sound that plays exactly once.
