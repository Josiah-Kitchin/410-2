Dot Product (Hai)
I created an arrow that changes color depending on if the player is facing the direction of the exit or not. It changes to red if they are facing the opposite direction, meaning that the dot product was less than or equal to 0. It turns green if the player is facing the exit, meaning that the dot product is greater than 0.

Linear Interpolation (Josiah)
I used linear interpolation to zoom the camera out when the game first starts, for cinematic effect. 
It works by setting a start and end FOV, with a zoom out duration. It then uses linear interpolation to 
increase the fov over time until it reaches the end fov 

Particle Effect (Axel)

Sound Effect (Miro)
I created a trigger so that if you walk into the bathroom 
straight ahead, you will notice a strange sound that plays exactly once.
